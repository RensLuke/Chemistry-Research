CONSTRAINTS in .run files have different names from what you put into the .geo file

TORSION = DIHED
BOND = DIST
ANGLE = ANGLE

Multiple constraints for each object in .geo file

WHAT EVERYTHING IN THE .run FILE MEANS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

inside .out file
dont chang first line, tells where files execution is
Can change the title, donest matter

BASIS = where you get all of the information for the orbital wave functions // .2p = frozen core appriximationt trating the inner electors as a group component (single value)

relativistic effects = different speeds around a single point 

Solvation (sometime nessary)
Bull Shit a way to have a solvent effect on the molecules

SCF (Self Consistent Field)
Iterative calculation help minimize energy after movement (At each movement in the gemotry the energy it take at each iteration)
(Pacing yourself in a marathon comparsion)

XC (exchange corrlation functional)
calculate electron densitys // BBE REAXFF generally uses this 

GEOMETRY
Geometry movenets of the molecules
Smooth = no reandom jumps down
iterations = amount of movements (more as you need more to have it be more oprimized)

:: = comment out 

symmetry NOSYM (makings sure that you can not defining groups into symmetrtrical structs as they natrurally want to my symmetrical)

TO CREATE THE CHILDREN .RUN FILES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEPS BEFORE
1. Dr. Barngrover creates the original parent .run file 
2. Run the .run files through ADF and generate a .out (with the final geometry coordinates)

STEPS ONCE YOU GET A .OUT FILES
1. Take the parent .run file and create an identical copy
2. After the GEOMETRY block, add a CONSTRAINTS block
	2a. Inside the CONSTRAINTS block, take user input with a selection menu of 3 possible constraints and ask them to enter in constraint information 
	2b. Append those constraints in a format that looks like
			CONSTRAINTS
			DIHED . . . . .
			DIST . . . 
			ANGLE . . . 
			END
3. After the constraint block add all the Atoms that the parents .run file generated(in the parents .out file)
	3a. Take out the Energy Terms for Final Geometry form the parent .out file
	3b. Append it after the CONSTRAINTS block
4. After the ATOM block is added, append closing ending block, example below
	END
	END INPUT
